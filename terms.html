If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>

                            <blockquote><h2 class="osLight">General. </h2></blockquote>

All Services used by the U.S. Government are provided with the commercial license rights described herein. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Use will continue in effect. The section titles in these Terms of Use are solely used for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or contractual significance. Legacy Metropolitan LLC may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign these Terms of Use, or assign, transfer or sublicense your rights, if any, in the Service. Legacy Metropolitan LLC's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Except as expressly stated herein, these Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Legacy Metropolitan LLC with respect to the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications of any kind between you and Legacy Metropolitan LLC with respect to the Services. The following sections of these Terms of Use shall survive any termination of these Terms of Use: 3, 11, 12, 13, 15 through 18..</p>
